The base of a number in base-x shows 1 greater than the maximum for any given place value (I think digit would work better here. To convert from any number in base x to base 10, one must multiply the place value by the corresponding base raised to a certain power (its num value). The certain power for the right most digit is 0, and for all other digits the power is just +1 moving to the left.

1.
 Binary is a base 2 system. Its useful because it only has 2 possible values for any place value, either 1 or 0 (on or off). This is useful because a numerical input number can be easily converted to base 2 which can represent a series of ons and offs.


2.
This is how you convert from base 2 to base 10 or the decimal system. First multiply right most digit by 2^0, then the next value by 2^1, and then continue until there are no more digits to the left.


3.
The first step is to subtract the largest power of two possible (while keeping the difference positive). Then you try x-1 until x is 0, so in this case we started with 2^3, because 8>9, and 2^4=16>9 so we started with that. Then we tried 2^2 which led to an answer < 0, afterwards we tried 2^1, which still resulted in a number <0. finally we got to 2^0, which led to an answer equal to 0.

Now to actually convert. Each valid subtraction corresponds to a 1, while tthe non successful ones correspond to a zero.

We them concatenate the numbers from left to right starting with the greatest power of 2 and successively working our way down to 2^0.

So we ended up with 1001_2 which is equal to 9_10.
