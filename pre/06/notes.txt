Learned about while loops and for loops in java; the while loop syntax in java bears similarity to the python while loop:

while (boolean) {
  statemnts;
}

The for loop is different than python, but is just a way of writing a while loop; INITIALIZATION is the initial condition on the variable you are looping through, TEST refers
to stopping the loop (when the test fails, the loop stops), and INCREMENT refers to what happens to the initialized variable each time we run the loop.

for (INITIALIZATION, TEST, INCREMENT) {
  do stuff;
}
