Made first java files, using atom to store them and the Windows Powershell to run and test them.

After creating the file in atom and saving it, I opened powershell and opened my directory; then I wrote javac Hello.java, which compiled the atom file as java code, then
ran java Hello in order to see what the file would return after running.

Mainly everything ran smoothly this assignment, other than me realizing that the desktop with my APCS file that I was trying to access was in the wrong place :p.
