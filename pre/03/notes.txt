Learned about void methods, i.e. about java "functions" (called methods) that are not based on any input variables; somewhat similar to a python script that would
print a given string.

The syntax of any method in java is as follows:

public static RETURNTYPE NAME(ARGUMENTS){
 BODY
}

Where RETURNTYPE refers to what is returned, and the arguments are your inputs.
