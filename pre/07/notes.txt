Arrays in Java were probably the most confusing part of the summer assignment, as I kept running into syntax issues and was confused where I was going wrong.

Arrays can be thought of as "ordered sequences" (with possible repeating values), where the value of the nth term in the sequence corresponds to the nth term in the array.

You can declare an integer array using
int[] a
a = new int[5];
Where a is the name of your list, and the array has 5 more entries than before (which must be defined).

To define an element of an array, we can write
a[3] = 5;
which gives the element with index 3 a value of 5.

To print an array, we can use this code:
public static void printArray(int[] a) {
    System.out.print("{" + a[0]);
    for (int i = 1; i < a.length; i++) {
        System.out.print(", " + a[i]);
    }
    System.out.println("}");
}
