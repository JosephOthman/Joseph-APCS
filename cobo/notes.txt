Activity 1:
1.
a) public static double sentimentVal( String word )
b) A String is required. If a String is not the input, then an "Incompatible types" error appears.
c) Yes; the method returns a double.
2.
basketball    0.45
ashamed      -1.47
math          0.21
3.
a) This would compile, since the variable type matches with the return type.
b) This would not compile, since Strings and doubles are different.
c) This would not compile, since the input of sentimentVal is incorrect.

Activity 2:
4.
I'm using split() to divide the input String by spaces, and iterating along each of the words in
this String[] array in order to determine the totalSentiment value.
5.
a) Somewhat; if a review is short, it's more likely to be around an average review, no matter
what is said in it.
b) Instead of taking the entire sum, take the average of all sentimentVals and use that to determine a rating.
6.
a) Either the statement in line 4 is true, or none of the conditional statements are true at all; thus
the method will either return 4 or 0.
b) To fix this, you can flip the sign of each comparing operator in the conditional statements.

Note: due to timing, I was unable to complete more than 2 activities in this lab.
